    "> If the only thing dictionaries could do with keys was an equality check (is the user-supplied key the same as the key for this entry), such lookups would be extremely inefficient; for example, you would have to do an equality check on every key in the dictionary to find out that you didn't have an entry for a particular key. Hash identities are the answer. Instead of checking for equality with every entry's key, dictionaries only have to check the keys with the same hash identity. If things work out (ie, there are only a few keys in the dictionary with the same hash identity), this will be a lot fewer entries and thus the lookup will run much faster.[source](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/UnderstandingHashing)\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that mutability and hashing are different but related concepts. The two ideas are related because objects which are used as hash keys must typically be immutable so their hash value doesn't change. If it was allowed to change then the location of that object in a data structure such as a hashtable would change and then the whole purpose of hashing for efficiency is defeated.

    "#### 20. Can we only base our hash on immutable values? / Can we hash on non-unique values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can and should only hash on immutable values. If an attribute changes over its lifetime, then it justifiably doesn't uniquely identify an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, technically, we *can* hash on non-unique values. \n",
    "\n",
    "A general rule when implementing \\__hash\\__ is that you should never base your hash on mutable values. In the above e.g., I hashed on a (immutable) tuple of name and color, essentially treating the two as a composite key. But two objects with the same name and colors would give identical hashes! So it's not unique, but key lookup still works because, while there's a hash collision (2 objects are referred to with the same hashed int), python then does an equality check. The lookup becomes less efficient because of the collision requiring extra work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken to the hypothetical extreme: a hashing function that always returns the same value for all elements basically regresses the complexity of the hash table from $O(1)$ back to $O(n)$. [source](https://hynek.me/articles/hashes-and-equality/)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you implement \\__hash\\__() that invokes hash() on a mutable object, it would throw `TypeError: unhashable type:...`. But you can indeed hash non-unique immutables, it'll just increase your chances of collision and make your key lookup less efficient.\n",

    "Good garbage collection depends on the application. The garbage collector should be invoked as often as necessary to collect cyclic references without affecting vital application performance. Garbage collection should be a part of your Python application design process.[source](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001537/references/r_python_garbage_coll.htm)\n",
    "- Not too frequently as it takes considerable time to evaluate every memory object in a large system.\n",
    "- Piggy-back collection after daily chores e.g. If there's a daily task to evaluate tons of data points, generate a report and send it off, it's a good candidate to run gc.collect() afterwards.\n",
    "- Don't do gc.collect() during time-sensitive sections of code. Do it before or after to not disrupt timing.\n",
